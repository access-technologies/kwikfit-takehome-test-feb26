This repository is a **public template** for our take-home test. Please create your own private copy before starting.

## How to start
1. Click **Use this template** (top-right on GitHub).
2. Create a **new private repository** under your personal GitHub account.
3. Clone your private repository locally and work from there.

> Please keep your solution repository **private** until the hiring process is complete.

## Assignment brief
- See: [`take_home_test.md`](./take_home_test.md)

## Submission
When you are done:
1. Email us:
   - your repo link
   - rough time spent (estimate)
   - any notes/tradeoffs you’d like us to consider
2. You will be asked to add the reviwer a collaborator to your private repo (read access is enough). Your reviewer's details will be shared after you email us.


## Rules / Expectations
- Timebox: **6–10 hours** (stop at ~10 hours and write “Next Steps” if incomplete)
- Do **not** commit secrets or real credentials
- Aim for incremental commits (we review the commit history)
- Your solution should be runnable via:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev`
  - `npm test`

## Troubleshooting
If you have questions or find ambiguities in the brief, message us. Reasonable assumptions are fine, just document them.
